Automata Theory. IIT Dharwad.

### Tips
- Key to automata theory: Solving questions.
- Use Hopcroft's book, and the other book mentioned for equivalence classes. A markdown file including exact sources for different topics is also in this repo.
- Solve IITB Tutorial questions.
- Even if you aren't able to solve something, write out as much as you can solve/think of. The rough idea may even fetch most of the allotted marks.
